# solar-power 

📖 Project Overview:-

This project focuses on predicting Solar Radiation using machine learning techniques.
The model analyzes weather-related features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure to estimate radiation levels.
The goal is to demonstrate data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and implementation of a Random Forest Regression model.

🎯 Problem Statement:-
Solar radiation is influenced by various environmental factors.
Accurate prediction of radiation helps in:
---Improving solar energy planning
---Increasing efficiency of solar systems
---Supporting renewable energy optimization
---Enhancing decision-making for power generation
This project builds a predictive model to estimate radiation based on weather data.
